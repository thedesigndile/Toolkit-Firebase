Design a minimalist PDF tool website UI similar to ilovepdf.com with a light blue gradient background (#cfe8ff to #9ecaff). The interface should be clean, functional, and responsive, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

**Core Pages & Layout**

1. **Landing Page**  
   - Full‑width hero section with a centered headline, sub‑headline, and primary call‑to‑action button (“Get Started”).  
   - Background: subtle linear gradient from left to right (top lighter, bottom darker).  
   - Hero image placeholder: use a royalty‑free illustration from Unsplash that conveys PDF editing, centered horizontally.  

2. **Tool Grid**  
   - Three‑column grid on desktop, two‑column on tablet, single‑column on mobile.  
   - Each tool card contains:  
     - **Icon** (use FontAwesome solid icons, e.g., fa-file-merge, fa-file-extract, fa-file-compress).  
     - **Title** (short, e.g., “Merge PDF”).  
     - **Short description** (optional, 1‑2 words).  
     - **Hover state**: icon scales to 1.05×, color changes to a slightly darker blue (#6c8fbb), tooltip fades in above icon with brief instruction.  
     - Card border radius: 8px, subtle box‑shadow for depth.  
   - CTA button inside each card: “Try It” with a gentle pulse animation when hovered.  

3. **Footer**  
   - Two‑row layout: first row with quick links (About, Help, Terms, Privacy).  
   - Second row with social icons (FontAwesome brands icons) that change to a darker shade on hover.  
   - Copyright notice centered.  

**Color Palette**

- Primary gradient: #cfe8ff → #9ecaff (light to medium blue).  
- Accent color for buttons and icons on hover: #6c8fbb.  
- Text: dark gray (#333333) for primary text, light gray (#777777) for secondary.  
- Background: white (#ffffff) for hero overlay and tool cards.  

**Typography & Fonts**

- Base font: system UI (Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif).  
- Headings: 32px, weight 600, color #222222.  
- Body: 16px, weight 400, color #555555.  
- Use Google Fonts “Poppins” as an optional alternative; fallback to system.  

**Interaction & Animation**

- Icons: 0.2s ease‑in‑out scaling and color change on hover.  
- Tool card button: 0.3s ease‑in‑out pulse animation on hover.  
- Tooltip: 0.15s fade‑in with slight upward movement.  
- Page transitions: fade‑in for navigation links.  

**Texture & Material**

- Minimal, no background textures.  
- Flat design with subtle shadows for depth.  
- Rounded corners on all interactive elements.  

**Device Context & Responsiveness**

- Mobile viewport: 375×812px (iPhone XR).  
- Tablet viewport: 768×1024px (iPad).  
- All interactive elements ≥44px touch target.  
- Navigation collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile with smooth slide‑in drawer.  

**Accessibility**

- All icons have aria‑label attributes.  
- Contrast ratios ≥4.5:1 for primary text vs. background.  
- Focus outlines for keyboard navigation.  

**References & Resources**

- Use copyright‑free resources like FontAwesome, Unsplash, Pexels, or similar services for image, font, and video placeholders.  
- Example icons: fa-file-merge, fa-file-extract, fa-file-compress, fa-file-shred.  
- Example image placeholder: “https://source.unsplash.com/collection/1139422/800x600”.

**Final Deliverables**

- High‑resolution mockup for desktop (1440×1024).  
- Responsive adaptive design for tablet and mobile (320×568).  
- Interactive prototype links (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD) with hover states and tooltip interactions implemented.  

Ensure all navigation links between pages are functional (href="#") and the design maintains a consistent minimalist aesthetic throughout.
